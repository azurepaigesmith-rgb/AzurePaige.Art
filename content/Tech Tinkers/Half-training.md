## Essential Tips for Success

Trail running involves more than just logging miles. These tips cover crucial areas like strength, technique, and nutrition.

### 1. Strength & Cross-Training (1-2 days/week)
Trail running requires more stability and single-leg strength than road running. On your non-running days, incorporate 20-30 minutes of strength work.

* **Core:** Planks, side planks, bird-dog, dead bug.
* **Legs:** Bodyweight squats, lunges (forward and lateral), glute bridges, and calf raises.
* **Stability:** Single-leg deadlifts (no weight needed at first) and standing on one foot.
* **Cross-Training:** Hiking is a perfect cross-training activity! It uses similar muscles but with less impact. Yoga or cycling are also great options.

### 2. Trail Technique
* **Look Ahead:** Don't stare at your feet. Scan the trail 10-15 feet ahead of you to pick your line and anticipate obstacles.
* **Uphills:** Shorten your stride, stay upright, and use your arms. It is often more efficient to "power hike" steep sections than to run them. Don't be afraid to walk!
* **Downhills:** Avoid leaning back and braking with your heels. Try to stay more perpendicular to the slope, keep your feet landing underneath you, and use your arms for balance. Think "controlled falling."
* **Lift Your Feet:** Roots and rocks love to grab toes. Consciously lift your feet a little higher than you would on the road.

### 3. Gear Recommendations
* **Trail Running Shoes:** The most important investment. They offer better grip, protection, and stability than road shoes.
* **Hydration Vest or Pack:** For any run over 60-75 minutes, you'll need to carry water and fuel.
* **Socks:** Non-cotton, moisture-wicking socks are a must to prevent blisters.
* **Anti-Chafe Balm:** Useful for long runs.

### 4. Nutrition & Hydration
* **Practice on Long Runs:** Use your long runs to figure out what fuel works for you. Don't try anything new on race day!
* **General Guideline:** For runs over 90 minutes, aim to consume 30-60 grams of carbohydrates per hour. This can be from gels, chews, or real food.
* **Hydrate:** Sip water from the start of your long runs. If it's hot, consider adding an electrolyte tablet to your water.
