        <section>
            <p>Welcome to Azure Paige's portfolio of creations and tinkers. I am happy you stopped by to peruse.</p>
            <p>My interests are varied and far flung, therefore this page will be too. Enjoy!</p>
            <p>I'm a Southern Utah native that has lived all over the western US.</p>
            <p>I grew up creating and tinkering, thinking back to the retro days of OG MySpace writing up silly profiles 
                with whatever wild HTML code we could slap together (before AI and great documentation might I add). These 
                days I am interested in spending time in nature whether on trails or water, creating art, hanging out with 
                my family, and toying around with a new fitness adventure.</p>
