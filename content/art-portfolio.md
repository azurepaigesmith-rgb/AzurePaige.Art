Bio: 
Azure Paige's artistic vision is deeply rooted in the dramatic landscape of southern Utah. Having grown up amidst the orange-red cliffs and graduated from Tuacahn Performing Arts High School, her formative years were spent immersed in the vibrant textures and subtle details of the desert—from the grand, sweeping formations to the intricate, lichen-speckled sandstone. This environment inspires her alcohol ink work, which is defined by vibrant colors and compelling, dynamic textures. Influenced by the light and atmosphere found in Impressionism, particularly the works of Monet and Renoir, Ms. Paige's pieces serve as an invitation to the viewer: to pause and contemplate the grandeur of their surroundings or to discover the unexpected beauty hidden in the minor details of daily life.
