# Neo CMS

Welcome to [Neo CMS](https://github.com/CrowderSoup/Neo-CMS) your tiny flat-file CMS. This is one `index.html` that reads markdown from `/content`.

- Drop a new `.md` file inside `/content`.
- Add it to `content/index.json`.
- Link it from the menu. Done.

---

## What you get

- Markdown rendering with headings, lists, links, code, and blockquotes.
- Hash-based routing so every page is a shareable URL.
- No build step, no dependencies, no database.

> This is intentionally small. Modify the HTML, tweak the CSS, and make it your own.

## Example code

```
const words = ["plain", "fast", "cute"];
console.log(words.join(" / "));
```
