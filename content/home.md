Welcome to Azure Paige's portfolio of creations and tinkers. I am happy to stopped by to puruse. My interests are varied and far flung, this page will be too. Enjoy!

But first! A bit about me!

Southern Utah native that has lived all over the western US. I grew up creation and tinkering, thinking back to the retro days of OG MySpace writing up silly profiles with whatever wild code we could slap together (before AI and great documenation might I add). 

These days I am interested in spending time in nature whether on trails or water, creating art, hanging out with my family, and toying around with a new fitness adventure.
